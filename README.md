# GenX-EA Script: AI-Powered Trading Bot

This project is a comprehensive framework for a trading bot that leverages machine learning to predict market movements and execute trades on the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange. It is containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Uses a pre-trained `scikit-learn` model to predict market trends.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects classic candlestick patterns from market data.
- **Signal Analysis**: Combines AI predictions and technical patterns to generate trading signals.
- **Bybit Integration**: Connects directly to the Bybit V5 API for real-time data and order execution.
- **Containerized**: Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose for a consistent development and production environment.
- **Backend Focused**: Includes a backend API (`server`), and the core Python trading logic (`python`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python Service**:
  - **Python 3.10+**
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning predictions.
  - **Pybit**: For Bybit API communication.
  - **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Server**: Node.js (Setup for a backend API, e.g., Express).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GenX-EA_Script.git
cd GenX-EA_Script
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

The Python service requires Bybit API keys to function.

1.  Copy the example `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Open the `.env` file and add your Bybit API Key and Secret. You can generate these from your Bybit API Management page.

    ```ini
    # .env
    BYBIT_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    BYBIT_API_SECRET="YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
    ```

### 3. Build and Run the Application

Use Docker Compose to build the images and start all the services.

```bash
# Build the images for all services
docker-compose build

# Start all services in detached mode
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Accessing the Services

- **Python Service**: The trading logic runs in the background. You can view its logs with `docker-compose logs -f python`.
- **Backend Server**: Accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
- **API Server**: Accessible at `http://localhost:8000` with interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Deployment

This project is designed to be deployed using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mouy-leng/GenX-EA_Script.git
   cd GenX-EA_Script
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file from the example:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Edit the `.env` file with your credentials and domain information.
4. Build and run the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

The application will be available at your domain. The API will be at `api.yourdomain.com`.

### Systemd Service

A systemd service file is provided to ensure the application starts on boot. To use it:

1. Copy the `genx-ea.service` file to `/etc/systemd/system/`:
   ```bash
   sudo cp genx-ea.service /etc/systemd/system/
   ```
2. Reload the systemd daemon:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
3. Enable the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable genx-ea.service
   ```
4. Start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start genx-ea.service
   ```

### CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Pushes to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a deployment to the DigitalOcean Droplet. You will need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

- `DROPLET_IP`: The IP address of your DigitalOcean Droplet.
- `DROPLET_USERNAME`: The username to use for SSH access.
- `DROPLET_SSH_KEY`: The private SSH key for password-less login.
