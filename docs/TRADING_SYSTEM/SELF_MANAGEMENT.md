# Self-Management and Autonomous Updates

## Goals
- Autonomous proposals for code/config/model updates
- Guardrails: tests, simulations, canary, human-in-the-loop when required

## Agent Workflow
1. Observe telemetry, performance, and error budgets
2. Propose change (config tweak, model promotion, code edit)
3. Create PR with rationale, tests, and rollback plan
4. Run CI/CD gates; canary deploy
5. Promote or rollback based on SLOs

## Safety
- Hard caps on risk; change freeze on breaches
- Require approvals for high-impact changes
