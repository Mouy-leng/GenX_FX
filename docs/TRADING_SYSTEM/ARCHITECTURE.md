# Autonomous Trading System Architecture

## Goals
- Real-time market analysis with AI/ML
- Automated trade execution via broker APIs/MetaTrader
- 24/7 operations with self-healing and autoscaling
- Self-managed codebase with safe autonomous updates
- Seamless local and cloud deployments

## High-Level Components
- Data Ingestion: market feeds, historical loaders, feature stores
- Research & Training: offline notebooks/pipelines, experiment tracking
- Model Registry & Serving: versioned models with canary/rollback
- Strategy Engine: signal generation, risk management, position sizing
- Execution Layer: broker adapters (REST/WebSocket), MetaTrader bridge
- Orchestrator: scheduler, health checks, backoff, failover
- Observability: logging, metrics, tracing, dashboards, alerts
- Governance: permissions, secrets, policy, change management
- Auto-Update Agent: propose/apply updates with guardrails

## Data Flows
1) Ingest → Feature Store → Strategy Engine → Execution → Broker
2) Ingest → Training → Model Registry → Serving → Strategy Engine
3) Telemetry → Observability → Alerting → Orchestrator actions

## Reliability & Safety
- Circuit breakers around brokers and market conditions
- Kill-switches and exposure caps
- Rollback for models, configs, and deployments

## Environments
- Local single-node
- Cloud managed (containers, autoscaling)
- Hybrid with shared registries and artifact stores
