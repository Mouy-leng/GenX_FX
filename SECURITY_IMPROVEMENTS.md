# Security Vulnerability Remediation Summary

This document summarizes the actions taken to address the security vulnerabilities identified in the initial report.

## 1. Credential Exposure (CVE-2025-55306) - **FIXED**

*   **Issue**: A hardcoded fallback Firebase API key was discovered in `client/src/firebase/config.ts`.
*   **Action Taken**: The hardcoded key and other fallback values have been removed. The application now relies exclusively on environment variables for Firebase configuration, which is the correct and secure practice.

## 2. Dockerfile Vulnerability - **FIXED**

*   **Issue**: The `Dockerfile.production` file contained an incorrect path for copying Python dependencies, referencing `python3.11` instead of the correct `python3.13`. This would have led to build failures or an unstable runtime.
*   **Action Taken**: The path has been corrected to `python3.13`, ensuring the production container is built with the correct dependencies.

## 3. Dependency Vulnerabilities - **VERIFIED**

*   **`requests`, `pyyaml`, `rich`**: The installed versions of these packages were found to be up-to-date and not vulnerable to the reported CVEs.
*   **`typer`**: While `typer` is used in the project, the required version is `>=0.9.0`, which is not vulnerable to CVE-2022-24882.

## 4. Development Environment - **IMPROVED**

*   **Issue**: The `pyproject.toml` file had conflicting development dependency definitions, which prevented the installation of testing tools.
*   **Action Taken**: The development dependencies have been consolidated into a single, standard `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]` section to ensure a consistent and functional testing environment.

## Recommendations for Ongoing Security

*   **Regularly Scan Docker Images**: While I have fixed the immediate issue in the Dockerfile, it is highly recommended to integrate a container scanning tool (like the existing Trivy action) to run on a regular schedule to catch new vulnerabilities in the base image or system dependencies.
*   **Enforce Secret Scanning**: The `ci-cd.yml` workflow already includes Gitleaks. Ensure this check is enforced on all pull requests to prevent new secrets from being committed.
*   **Dependency Updates**: Continue to use Dependabot and `pip-audit` to monitor for and promptly update outdated or vulnerable dependencies.
*   **User Education**: Remind developers to never commit `.env` files or hardcode secrets, and to always use the environment variable system provided.
